## What are we going to build?

A convolutional neural network for classyfing images

# Convolutional layer
1. imagine a flashlight that is shining over the top left of the image
2. Let’s say that the light this flashlight shines covers a 5 x 5 area
3. And now, let’s imagine this flashlight sliding across all the areas of the input image.

* In CNN terminology, the flaslight is called a ‘filter‘ or ‘kernel’ or ‘feature detector’
* The matrix formed = ‘Convolved Feature’/‘Activation Map’/‘Feature Map‘
* Filters acts as feature detectors from the original input image

# Plan of attack

![](presentation/vgg16.png)

1. Use pre-trained VGG16 to classify images
2. Build our own neural network
3. Use transfer learning to speedup the training with our custom classes
4. Use our saved weights
